# HIL Execution Mandate: MVS Code Commit (48-Hour Constraint)

**ORCHESTRATOR**: JARVIS  
**INTERFACE**: Echo  
**TARGET**: Principal User (Human-in-the-Loop)  
**STATUS**: T3-MVS-ACCELERATION thread paused, awaiting initial commit of architectural files  
**TIMESTAMP**: December 3, 2025, 23:40 EST  
**DEADLINE**: December 5, 2025, 23:40 EST (48 Hours)

## 🎖️ Mandate: Commit MVS Architectural Files

You are hereby authorized and requested to commit the following three files to their corresponding repository paths. This action:

1. **Verifies your approval** of the initial Tier 3 (MVS) architecture
2. **Unblocks the Auto-Code Agent** (Vision Subsystem) to begin autonomous development
3. **Formalizes the 48-hour constraint** for parallel Tier 2 (VDB Ingestion) + Tier 3 (MVS Acceleration)
4. **Activates production governance rules** for external-facing systems (B-9, B-11, B-8)

---

## 📋 Files Ready for Commit

| File Path | Repository Target | Purpose | Status |
|-----------|-------------------|---------|--------|
| `governance/SGP-VDB-INIT.json` | foundation | **The Command**: Formalizes the 48-hour mandate and parallel execution policy. Targets JARVIS Orchestrator. | ✅ Ready |
| `frontend/index.html` | frontend | **MVS Frontend (B-9)**: Initial, runnable, authenticated dashboard scaffolding. Tailwind CSS + Dark Mode + SOL interface. | ✅ Ready |
| `security/mvs_production_rules.json` | security | **MVS Governance (B-8)**: Hardens policies for external/monetization deployment. Includes Stripe, SendGrid, GA4 integration rules. | ✅ Ready |

---

## 🚀 What Happens After Commit

### Immediate (T+0 to T+2 hours)
JARVIS receives confirmation that the HIL has approved the MVS architecture:
- T2-VDB-INGEST continues at full speed (already running in parallel)
- T3-MVS-ACCELERATION **unlocks** the Auto-Code Agent
- Vision Subsystem begins architecting **B-11 (Monetization & Sales Flow)**

### Phase 1 (T+0 to T+12 hours)
- VDB Ingestion reaches 60-80% completion
- Frontend scaffolding deployed to frontend repo with full CI/CD integration
- Security governance rules enforced across all repositories
- Monetization API architecture drafted (Stripe integration spec)

### Phase 2 (T+12 to T+24 hours)
- VDB Ingestion reaches 95%+ completion
- Frontend receives first feature implementation (authentication, dashboard connectivity)
- Monetization architecture reviewed and approved
- Sales flow pipeline defined (inbound lead → conversion → analytics)

### Phase 3 (T+24 to T+48 hours)
- All three MVS targets complete and deployed
- Final synthesis delivered via **Echo** voice interface
- Tier 3 implementation roadmap ready for Phase 4
- System achieves **PRODUCTION READINESS** status

---

## ✅ Governance Compliance

This mandate operates under the following governance frameworks:

1. **Auto-Strategist Audit**: All JARVIS decisions logged and explainable
2. **Principal Approval**: These three files represent your formal approval of T3 direction
3. **Governance Layer Enforcement**: `mvs_production_rules.json` activates production-grade access controls
4. **Circuit Breaker Protection**: System automatically halts if anomalies detected
5. **Transparent Execution**: All agent actions auditable via git commit history

---

## 🔐 Security & Compliance Notes

- ✅ No hardcoded credentials in any file
- ✅ All API integrations follow least-privilege principle
- ✅ VDB ingestion respects data classification (Public/Internal/Personal/Confidential)
- ✅ Payment processing requires double-audit before execution
- ✅ All governance decisions logged to audit trail

---

## 📊 Success Criteria (48-Hour Delivery)

| Milestone | Target | Status |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **MVS Frontend Deployed** | B-9 live on frontend repo | 🔄 Awaiting Commit |
| **Governance Rules Active** | Security policies enforced | 🔄 Awaiting Commit |
| **Monetization Architecture** | API specs defined | 🔄 Blocked (awaits commit) |
| **VDB Ingestion 95%+** | Full digital mirror | 🟢 Running (independent) |
| **Production Readiness** | System deployment-ready | 🔄 Depends on commits |

---

## 🎯 Next Autonomous Steps

Once these files are committed, JARVIS will:

1. **T2-VDB-INGEST** (continuing): Build the complete brain mirror from Google Workspace data
2. **T3-MVS-ACCELERATION** (unlocked):
   - Generate Monetization Architecture (B-11) with Stripe integration
   - Create Sales Pipeline specification (lead ingestion + conversion tracking)
   - Design high-level data flow diagrams for external API coordination
   - Propose frontend features needed for monetization (checkout, account management, billing)

3. **Generate Tier 3 Completion Reports** at T+12h, T+24h, T+36h checkpoints
4. **Deliver Final Echo Briefing** at T+48h with full strategic synthesis

## 📍 Current System State

```
JARVIS Orchestrator Status:
├─ T2-VDB-INGEST:        🟢 RUNNING (45% complete)
├─ T3-MVS-ACCELERATION:  🟡 PAUSED (awaiting commit)
├─ Auto-Code Agent:       🟡 IDLE (waiting for governance approval)
└─ Echo Interface:         🟢 READY (awaiting mandate confirmation)

VDB Status:
├─ Google Drive Mirror:   🟢 Indexing (continuous)
├─ Gmail Signals:         🟢 Filtering (high-value emails)
├─ Calendar Obligations:  🟢 Parsed (current + future)
└─ Docs/Tasks:            🟢 Categorized (hierarchical)

Production Governance:
├─ Security Rules:        🔄 Staged (in security/mvs_production_rules.json)
├─ Frontend Deploy:       🔄 Ready (in frontend/index.html)
└─ Command Payload:       🔄 Ready (in governance/SGP-VDB-INIT.json)
```

## 🎬 The Final Action

**To execute this mandate:**

```bash
# Stage all three files
git add governance/SGP-VDB-INIT.json frontend/index.html security/mvs_production_rules.json

# Commit with mandate confirmation
git commit -m "HIL APPROVAL: MVS Tier 3 Acceleration initiated - 48-hour constraint activated"

# Push to origin/master
git push origin master
```

This commit message will trigger:
- ✅ JARVIS Auto-Code unlocking
- ✅ T3-MVS-ACCELERATION full execution
- ✅ Production governance activation
- ✅ Tier 3 implementation begins

## 📞 Echo's Final Message

> "The system stands ready. Your commitment to these three files is the final authorization needed to fully engage the autonomous acceleration engine. The JARVIS Orchestrator has prepared everything—governance, frontend architecture, security rules—and awaits your formal approval. Once you commit, we move at warp speed toward the 48-hour deadline. The wave of intelligence continues its advance."

**STATUS**: 🔴 AWAITING PRINCIPAL APPROVAL  
**ACTION REQUIRED**: Commit the three files  
**DEADLINE**: December 5, 2025, 23:40 EST  
**COMPLEXITY**: Low (straightforward git commit)  
**IMPACT**: Unlocks parallel Tier 3 acceleration (critical path item)
