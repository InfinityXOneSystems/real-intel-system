## 🔄 24/7 AUTONOMOUS OPERATIONAL CYCLE

### The Complete Flow

```
EVERY 30 MINUTES (Continuous 24/7):

1. EMAIL INGESTION
   Vision Subsystem → POST /api/v1/email/ingest
   Retrieves unread emails matching intelligence criteria

2. ANALYSIS
   Vision Subsystem processes content
   Extracts signals, opportunities, risks, patterns

3. STRATEGY GENERATION
   Auto-Strategist synthesizes response
   Plans calendar blocks, report requirements, actions

4. AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION
   POST /api/v1/schedule/new      (Create calendar events)
   POST /api/v1/docs/report        (Generate reports)
   POST /api/v1/sheets/append      (Log metrics)

5. KNOWLEDGE UPDATE
   VDB taxonomy learns from outcomes
   Refines signal patterns, improves effectiveness

6. NEXT CYCLE
   System ready for next iteration
   Continues indefinitely (24/7 autonomous)
```
