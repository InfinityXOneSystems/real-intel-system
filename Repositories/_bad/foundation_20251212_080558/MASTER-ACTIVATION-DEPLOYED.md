## 🧠 THE PARALLEL ACCELERATION ARCHITECTURE

### **TIER 2: Vector Database Initialization (VDB-INIT)**
**Assigned to**: Vision Subsystem + Storage Service + Google Workspace Connectors  
**Duration**: Ongoing (continuous ingestion starting immediately)  
**Priority**: CRITICAL

**What Happens**:
1. Full Google Drive mirrored and indexed into VDB
2. Email, Calendar, and Document data ingested using existing connectors
3. Personal domain (P-0 to P-6) constructed from fragmented data
4. Tasks/Keep system activated for continuous capture
5. All data unified into single VDB with bidirectional links

**Output**: Complete digital mirror of user's world (foundation for personalization)

---

### **TIER 3: Strategic Acceleration (ACCELERATION)**
**Assigned to**: Auto-Strategist Agent + LLM Router (Gemini + Copilot + Groq)  
**Duration**: Parallel with Tier 2 (independent)  
**Priority**: CRITICAL

**What Happens**:
1. 90-day milestone roadmap generated from user's personal intake
2. Frontend architecture specifications created (ready for dev team)
3. Sales/Monetization architecture with external API integrations defined
4. Enterprise governance framework proposed for deployment

**Output**: Complete strategic roadmap with implementation specifications
