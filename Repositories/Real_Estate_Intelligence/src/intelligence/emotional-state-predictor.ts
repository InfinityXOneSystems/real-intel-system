 * Tier 1 Intelligence: Predict seller's psychological state and negotiation leverage

 * This is the difference between:
 * - "Offer $400K" (generic)
 * - "Offer $410K because seller's ego is involved in divorce, she'll accept $10K more to 'win' over ex" (intelligent)
 *
 * Competitive Advantage: You know what seller ACTUALLY wants, not just what market says
